### Step 1- Initial Redesign

1. Create a search/ result page

   - one page/ new file called results.tsx (Following Figma layout)

2. Add components to include on the results.tsx page

   - Other elements added as Div Placeholders
     - Invesigate whether using some existing UI library components might help
   - Card Components (Card.tsx)

3. Introducing Other Components (or integrating UI library components)
   - NavBar (Navigation.tsx)
   - Create Post (CreatePost.tsx)
   - Search Bar/ Sort By component (SearchBar.tsx)
     --- How would these be linked?
   - Filter Bar (FilterBar.tsx)
